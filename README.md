    <h2> Relationships With Loved Ones After Psilocybin-Assisted Psychotherapy</h2>
    <h3>Mike</h3>
    <p>Mike is a father of three daughters...</p>
    <blockquote>"Bit by bit, my daughters were turning into these radiant beings, cleansed of all these fears. It was incredibly emotional, because it was something I have, as their father, long known, but it’s a very great pain when you see your children being victimized by fears . . . to see these beautiful beings not realizing their essence"</blockquote>

    <h3> Anonymous patient</h3>
    <blockquote>"I felt like I let go of a lot of anger and resentment towards my parents. I mean, I thought I had already done that, but I really hadn’t, and I kind of saw them more as, like, these flawed human beings who did the best they could.
".</blockquote>

    <h3>Dan</h3>
    <p>Dan is a former bank employee and real-estate investor...</p>
    <blockquote>"I was appreciating the pureness of her (my girlfriend), if you will, her being, in a way. In a way, I had not allowed myself, or not realized, or whatever the case was. And so that was pretty much immediate, but I felt like that had a lasting effect. I feel that kind of changed my perception of our relationship over the ensuing weeks in a way. It allowed me to be more open with her, express my appreciation a lot for her in way that I had not. I think it had a positive effect—kind of a bit of a snowball effect."</blockquote>
    <p>Dan reflected that the state of mind into which he entered helped him become “more emotionally open” to his girlfriend. Within 3 months, Dan bought an engagement ring and proposed marriage to her.</p>

    <h2>Patient Experience in a Trial of Psilocybin-Assisted Psychotherapy for Alcohol Use Disorder</h2>
    <h3>Mark</h3>
    <p>Mark was a Caucasian male in his 20s living with his parents and working full-time at the time of enrollment. His binge drinking began in his teens and intensified into adulthood. He reported frequent blackouts and occasional absences from work due to drinking episodes that lasted for days at a time. At baseline, he reported drinking on six of the past 84 days, with an average of 22 drinks per drinking day. Mark had made multiple unsuccessful attempts at treatment, and had attended hundreds of AA meetings. Mark started the study with the intention of attaining complete abstinence from alcohol.</p>
    <c>"I just want to stop and have a normal life."</blockquote>	
    <p>During the first medication session, Mark encountered his anxiety and fears associated with failure. Though the effects were mild and difficult for him to communicate in words</p>
    <blockquote>“It was almost like finding the Holy Grail and the answer to all of life’s questions.”</blockquote>
    <p>Mark’s second medication session was higher in both dose and intensity. He was confronted by the harmful effects that his drinking had on himself and others.</p>
    <blockquote>He stated that “at one point, I felt I could have cried for joy,” when realizing that he was being given “a new slate.”</blockquote>
    <p>Mark remained abstinent during the 7 months following the second medication session</p>
    <blockquote>“I wouldn’t be surprised if I never drank again,I got exactly what I need out of the experience.”</blockquote>
    <p>One month after this session, he remained abstinent and expressed a great deal of gratitude. Two years from his initial intake, Mark contacted to report that he continued to remain abstinent.</p>
