    <h2> Relationships between loved ones and the patients</h2>
    <h3>Mike, a father of three daughters</h3>
    <p>"Bit by bit, my daughters were turning into these radiant beings, cleansed of all these fears. It was incredibly emotional, because it was something I have, as their father, long known, but it’s a very great pain when you see your children being victimized by fears . . . to see these beautiful beings not realizing their essence"</p>
    <h3> Anonymous patient</h3>
    <p>"I felt like I let go of a lot of anger and resentment towards my parents. I mean, I thought I had already done that, but I really hadn’t, and I kind of saw them more as, like, these flawed human beings who did the best they could.

    <h3> Dan, a former bank employee and real-estate investor</h3>
    <p>"I was appreciating the pureness of her (my girlfriend), if you will, her being, in a way. In a way, I had not allowed myself, or not realized, or whatever the case was. And so that was pretty much immediate, but I felt like that had a lasting effect. I feel that kind of changed my perception of our relationship over the ensuing weeks in a way. It allowed me to be more open with her, express my appreciation a lot for her in way that I had not. I think it had a positive effect—kind of a bit of a snowball effect."</p>
    <p>Dan reflected that the state of mind into which he entered helped him become “more emotionally open” to his girlfriend. Within 3 months, Dan bought an engagement ring and proposed marriage to her.</p>
