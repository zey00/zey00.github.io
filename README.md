    <h1>Patient Experiences of Psychedelics</h1> 
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>REFINE THIS PART : Psilocybin has been being used for some time as an alternative for several conditions such as anxiety, clinical depression, and alcohol disorders. When talking about medical issues it's very easy for the patients to be reduced to just a statistic, often caused by a lack of listening to individual experiences. In this part of the exhibition, you will get to listen to the patient's individual experiences of several psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy studies. These experiences are unique... </p>

    <h2>Experiences of Alcohol Use Disorder in a Trial of Psilocybin-Assisted Psychotherapy</h2>
    <h3>Mark</h3>
    <p>Mark was a Caucasian male in his 20s living with his parents and working full-time at the time of enrollment. His binge drinking began in his teens and intensified into adulthood. He had frequent blackouts and occasional absences from work due to drinking episodes that lasted for days at a time. At baseline, he drank on six of the past 84 days, with an average of 22 drinks per drinking day. He had made multiple unsuccessful attempts at treatment and had attended hundreds of AA meetings.</p>
    <blockquote>"I just want to stop and have a normal life."</blockquote>	
    <p>During the first medication session, Mark encountered his anxiety and fears associated with failure. Though the effects were mild and difficult for him to communicate in words</p>
    <blockquote>“It was almost like finding the Holy Grail and the answer to all of life’s questions.”</blockquote>
    <p>Mark’s second medication session was higher in both dose and intensity. He was confronted by the harmful effects that his drinking had on himself and others.</p>
    <blockquote>He stated that “at one point, I felt I could have cried for joy,” when realizing that he was being given “a new slate.”</blockquote>
    <p>Mark remained abstinent during the 7 months following the second medication session</p>
    <blockquote>“I wouldn’t be surprised if I never drank again I got exactly what I need out of the experience.”</blockquote>
    <p>One month after this session, he remained abstinent and expressed a great deal of gratitude. Two years from his initial intake, Mark contacted to report that he continued to remain abstinent.</p>

    <h3>Lisa</h3>
    <p>Lisa was a Latin-American female in her 50s with a family history of alcoholism, physical and emotional abuse, abandonment, and neglect. Her problematic drinking began around the age of thirty and resulted in social isolation, hangovers, strong feelings of guilt and shame, and severe self-critical thoughts. At the start, she expressed concern regarding the effects that drinking was having on her physical and mental health. Lisa had made multiple previous attempts at treatment and attended a total of 29 AA meetings. She had been drinking on 20 out of the previous 84 days, averaging three drinks per drinking day.</p>
    <p>During the initial session, Lisa spent time exploring her mother’s neglect and abuse but noted that she did not experience any antagonism toward her. She examined the negative feelings that she harbored for herself and feelings of alienation from God. She remembered an inner voice exclaiming to God, <b>“Why did you leave me?”</b> to which God responded, <b>“Why are you so controlling?”</b> After this session, she noticed a significant brightening of her mood and a lasting decrease in self-critical thinking. In response to God’s message about her controlling tendencies, Lisa chose not to commit herself to complete abstinence at that time, though she found herself drinking much less.</p>
    <p>In the second session, Lisa received a higher dose of medication and experienced an amplification of thought moving her into a confused and chaotic state. Underneath the chaotic thinking, she identified a deep well of overwhelming sadness. She was able to eventually surrender control over her thoughts and entered into a state of peacefulness until her thoughts quieted completely. She heard her inner voice rupturing the quiet, whispering into her ear:</p>
    <blockquote> “I’m going to tell you a secret. It’s the worst-kept secret in the universe because everyone knows it but you. You are a perfect creation of the universe.”</blockquote>
    <p>At that moment she felt that everything in existence was unified and was made of love, though a part of her remained reluctant to fully believe this to be true. The voice repeatedly presented her with this reality, asking “do you believe this?” over and over until each one of her objections had been addressed and dismissed. She examined herself and found that she finally did accept this to be true, which propelled her into a state of profound self-acceptance and wellbeing. She later said:</p>
    <blockquote>“All there is is love, this is all that you are, this is all that matters.”</blockquote>
    <p>Following her medication session, Lisa reported that her self-critical thoughts had dissolved and that alcohol had lost almost all of its appeal. She said that the medication sessions had illuminated how she had been unkind to her body and had been harming herself with alcohol. She noted her ability to manage stress and found that she was making time to care for herself through socialization, relaxation, and a resumed meditation practice. She reported improved concentration, a lack of negative self-talk, decreased anxiety, and a spacious quality of mind</p>
    <blockquote> “The noise can bubble up but it doesn’t overwhelm me. When these little anxieties walk in this big room they seem so little. I feel peaceful, and I feel safe. It feels good to be in my body. I’ve found myself taking wonderful breaths. The negative remarks don’t even pop into my head.”</blockquote>
    <p>Before her third dosing session, she reported a dramatic and sustained increase in her anxiety, which she attributed to the results of the recent presidential election. She reported that the positive effects from the two previous sessions had persisted, and that alcohol was no longer problematic. She described being able to consume an occasional glass of wine while remaining free from the compulsion to overindulge. The only instance of drinking to excess was on one isolated occasion, which was the night of the election. Her intention for the third session was to find relief from her apprehension regarding the election outcome. She described the medication experience as consisting of several hours of pure and intense anxiety, with very little specific thought or perceptual content. The following day she reported that her anxiety had lifted and that she was feeling calm and peaceful. At 54 weeks, Lisa reported a persisting reduction in alcohol consumption and alleviated anxiety.</p>

    <h2> Relationships With Loved Ones After Psilocybin-Assisted Psychotherapy</h2>
    <p>The treatment journey of a patient is related to the physiological self-recovery as well as the process of healing the relationships with the social environment. Both the patients and the families of patients describe remarkable insights or transformations involving a significant personal relationship.</p>
    <h3>Mike</h3>
    <p>Mike a father of three daughters who struggled with anxiety</p>
    <blockquote>"Bit by bit, my daughters were turning into these radiant beings, cleansed of all these fears. It was incredibly emotional, because it was something I have, as their father, long known, but it’s a very great pain when you see your children being victimized by fears . . . to see these beautiful beings not realizing their essence"</blockquote>

    <h3> Anonymous patient</h3>
    <blockquote>"I felt like I let go of a lot of anger and resentment towards my parents. I mean, I thought I had already done that, but I really hadn’t, and I kind of saw them more as, like, these flawed human beings who did the best they could.
".</blockquote>

    <h3>Dan</h3>
    <p>Dan is a former bank employee and real-estate investor...</p>
    <blockquote>"I was appreciating the pureness of her (my girlfriend), if you will, her being, in a way. In a way, I had not allowed myself, or not realized, or whatever the case was. And so that was pretty much immediate, but I felt like that had a lasting effect. I feel that kind of changed my perception of our relationship over the ensuing weeks in a way. It allowed me to be more open with her, express my appreciation a lot for her in way that I had not. I think it had a positive effect—kind of a bit of a snowball effect."</blockquote>
    <p>Dan reflected that the state of mind into which he entered helped him become “more emotionally open” to his girlfriend. Within 3 months, Dan bought an engagement ring and proposed marriage to her.</p>

    <h2> Experiencing Psilocybin as a scientist and patient: The story of Dr. Roland Griffiths</h2>
    <p> He helped cancer patients find peace through psychedelics. Then came his diagnosis</p>
    <p>As the founding director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, Dr. Roland Griffiths has been a pioneer in investigating the ways in which psychedelics can help treat depression, addiction and, in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, psychological distress. He has also looked at how the use of psychedelics can produce transformative and long-lasting feelings of human interconnectedness and unity.</p> 
    <p>Griffiths, who was 76, has been diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic colon cancer. It’s a diagnosis, in all likelihood terminal</p>
